# Process Input File for CPU Scheduling Visualizer
# -----------------------------------------------
# Each line represents a single process in the format:
# ProcessName  ArrivalTime  BurstTime  Priority
#
# Notes:
# - ProcessName: Identifier (e.g., P1, P2, etc.)
# - ArrivalTime: Time at which the process arrives (integer)
# - BurstTime  : Total CPU time required (integer)
# - Priority   : Scheduling priority (lower number = higher priority)
#
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored as comments.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
#
# Example:
P1 0 5 2
P2 1 3 1
P3 2 8 3
P4 3 6 2
